# CNN-for-Radon-Transformation
Improving the quality of reconstruction image by radon transformation by CNN.  We will adpat the the Unet in Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Inverse Problems in Imaging[1] for our problems.

The convolution neural network is coded by tensorflow keras. Synthetic training dataset are generated by Matlab. It include 500 images of ellipses of random intensity, size, and location, sinograms for this data are created using matlab radon. After reproduction of the reference paper, we will consider to modify the CNN architecture to achieve image deconvolution for Terahertz CT imaging. Besides, we will investigate possiblity of realizing CT reconstruction by GANs rather than by traditional FBP or some other reconstruction algorithms. Our final target is realizing end-to-end Terahertz CT imaging reconstruction from blur convoluted sinograms to deconvoluted reconstruction images by deep neural network directly.

The Project will keep updating.

>The training data is composed of two different data set. The first one is ellipsoid dataset. Itâ€™s a synthetic dataset that comprises 500 >images of ellipses of random intensity, size, and location. Sinograms for this data are 729 pixels by 1,000 views and are created using >the analytical expression for the X-ray transform of an ellipse. The matlab function iradon is used for FBPs.
>The second training dataset is a biomedical synthetic dataset that comprises 500 real in-vivo CT images from the Low-dose Grand challenge >competition from database made by the Mayo clinic. Sinograms for this data are 729 pixels by 1,000 views and are created using the Matlab >function radon, iradon is again used for FBPs.

>The test dataset is a real CT dataset that comprises 377 sinograms collected from an experiment at the TOMCAT beam line of the Swiss >Light Source at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland.
>Each sinogram is 1493 pixels by 721 views and comes from one z-slice of a single rat brain.
